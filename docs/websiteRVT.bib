	abstract = {Perceiving work as a calling has been positioned as a key pathway to enhancing work-related well-being. However, no formal theory exists attempting to explain predictors and outcomes of living a calling at work. To address this important gap, this article introduces a theoretical, empirically testable model of work as a calling - the Work as Calling Theory (WCT) - that is suitable for the contemporary world of work. Drawing from research and theory in counseling, vocational, multicultural, and industrial-organizational psychology, as well as dozens of quantitative and qualitative studies on calling, the WCT is presented in three parts: (a) predictors of living a calling, (b) variables that moderate and mediate the relation of perceiving a calling to living a calling, and (c) positive (job satisfaction, job performance) and potentially negative (burnout, workaholism, exploitation) outcomes that result from living a calling. Finally, practical implications are suggested for counselors and managers, who respectively may seek to help clients and employees live a calling.

Unfortunately, many of these reports provide only frequency or bivariate-level data, fail to report the magnitude of differences or problems, and are not theoretically driven. We responded to these needs with a multivariate comparison of 63 MKs and 63 university students (with no expatriation history) from a Christian university. Results indicated significant differences between the MK and university student samples on measures of psychological well-being and sociocultural adaptation. Moreover, a mediated model, with sociocultural adaptation as a mediator between psychological well-being and MK status, was supported. MK supporters, such as recipient universities, mission-sending organisations, and the Christian fraternity Mu Kappa may be able to assist with some of the sociocultural adaptation challenges identified (e.g. understanding the American perspective, interacting with others, understanding humour).

Participants were 111 (87\% female; 72\% Caucasian) college students who participated in a short-term (13 to 62 d) global service learning immersion to one of 15 countries. International interests remained stable from pre-departure through 12 months re-entry and were best predicted by the pre-departure level of the same variable. Neither subjective nor objective cultural dislocation moderated the re-entry trajectory. The growth trajectory for psychological well-being was best explained by a cubic function. After re-entry, psychological well-being decreased, reaching its lowest point at approximately 4 months, and returned to baseline by 12. Subjectively reported sociocultural adaptation to the host country was a significant predictor to both the re-entry level of psychological well-being, the rate of decline, and the subsequent rate of return to baseline. Those who adapted more strongly to their host country experienced more psychological difficulty upon return and took longer to return to baseline. We recommend preparing students for the potential re-entry friction by adhering to known best practices for education abroad (i.e., providing ample pre-departure and re-entry programming and services). We suggest that pre-departure preparation include psychoeducation for stress and coping and we recommend framing the period of re-entry friction (contrasting reverse culture shock) as an invitation to personal growth and exploration.

Yet inequities in participation rates and lackluster reentry outcomes remain concerning. Our purpose was to investigate what students perceived to be preparatory for the upcoming study abroad/away programs in which they were enrolled. Consensual qualitative research–modified (Spangler, Liu, \& Hill, 2012) was used to analyze 1,199 responses from 458 students (up to three responses per student) regarding what best prepared them for study abroad. Participants were from three institutions with a mean age 20.69 (SD = 2.70; 72\% female). Regarding race/ethnicity, 55\% were White/Caucasian, 17\% Asian/Asian American, 16\% Hispanic/Latin\#, and 4\% Black/African American; 4\% were international students. Responses mapped well onto social cognitive career theory’s (SCCT) model of how basic career interests develop over time (Lent, 2013; Lent, Brown, \& Hackett, 1994). The correspondence of our results with SCCT provides reciprocal support for (a) the validity of SCCT as a theoretical frame to understand choice behaviors and (b) SCCT’s predictive utility in future investigations of education abroad. Disaggregation of data permitted comparisons of readiness. Previous international travel was the most frequent preparation for White/Caucasian students, previous study abroad was for international students, and moving away from home was most cited for students who withdrew. Further investigation of these differences has implications for (a) disparate access to resources, (b) program selection, and (c) tailoring preparation to maximize student engagement in global learning.

	abstract = {Stakeholders—including student affairs professionals, university administrators, faculty, parents, and students—have high expectations for student gains along global learning, academic, and psychosocial dimensions as a result of participation in study abroad learning experiences. As our introductory literature review shows, reentry outcomes are mixed, and there are consistent calls for comprehensive programmatic improvements that begin with selection, screening, and recruitment; continue through predeparture preparation; include in-country supports; and emphasize reentry debriefing, application, and integration. As study abroad educators seek ways to enhance and stabilize outcomes, the classroom seems a natural and logical place to begin. After reviewing related research, our chapter offers a sampling of assignments, activities, and cocurricular activities designed to foster development of one or more of the learning goals associated with internationalizing the undergraduate psychology curriculum (American Psychological Association [APA] Working Group on Internationalizing the Undergraduate Psychology Curriculum, 2005). Throughout this chapter, we use student quotations as illustrations of the reentry and integration experience. These quotes are results from an institutional review board–approved, longitudinal (predeparture through 12 months reentry), mixed methods evaluation of students participating in study abroad programs on our campus at Seattle Pacific University (SPU). The research project began in 2009 and continues as a quantitatively oriented program evaluation (Bikos, Tillmann, et al., 2013). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {We examined the effects of searching for calling, strength of faith, and time (in months) on the presence of calling among returnees from a faith-based international service-learning (ISL) program. Participants were 74 undergraduate students (M age = 19.79; 8\% female; 67\% Caucasian) whose near month-long (M = 84 months) immersion took them to host countries such as Rwanda, Vietnam, and Haiti. Students completed online surveys at pre-departure and at re-entry intervals of 2-weeks and 6-months. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling where person was the clustering variable. Presence of calling was identified by a quadratic function of time, peaking between 3- and 4-months re-entry and highest for those who are persistent in searching and have the strongest aggregate faith. Although study abroad researchers have long claimed re-entry effects (e.g., re-entry culture shock), our research is, perhaps, the first empirical evidence of a significant quadratic function for ISL returnees. Programmatic recommendations include pre-departure orientation and re-entry services that include framing the career decision-making process as one of discernment and incorporating theologically informed resources for faith-based programs such as these.

Snowball and social networking techniques were used to recruit globally dispersed participants. Participants were mostly female (59\%), represented 26 nationalities, and nearly all (99\%) were actively working within 53 international settings. Multiple regression analyses indicated that sociocultural adaptation and perceived organizational support from the host and home organizations made significant contributions to expatriates’ psychological well-being.

We suggest that host and home organizations employing expatriates work collaboratively to monitor their expatriates’ psychological well-being, perception of the adequacy of support provided, and communicate to provide integrated resources in response to expatriates’ dynamic needs.

They come from a number of world religions. They may sojourn overseas for only a few days or for a lifetime. They may be involved primarily in religious proselytising, or primarily in relief or development work. Roughly two-thirds of missionaries are sent from countries outside of North America (Jaffarian, 2007). What they have in common is a religious commitment which influences numerous aspects of their experience, including the motivation to go overseas, adaptation, coping, and repatriation. Consequently, the psychological study of missionaries is a rich source of information on the confluence of psychological factors, religion, and culture. In this special issue of Mental Health, Religion and Culture we bring together a collection of 10 articles that investigate various aspects of the psychological functioning of international missionaries and their families. The collection is topically rich and methodologically diverse. It expands the existing literature about international missionaries, serves as an important launching point for the next generation of research, and can be helpful to organisations and practitioners who support international missionaries and their families.

Results indicated that worker marital satisfaction and global psychological functioning means were lower at most time-in-country intervals. Moreover, normative comparisons, a statistical procedure used to compare worker scores of global psychological functioning to a normative sample of chronically ill medical patients, indicated that worker scores were meaningfully lower at three- and nine-month intervals. In contrast, workers valued marital, parental, occupational, and homemaker life roles more than other expats.

Our study employed a constructivist-interpretivist approach with Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) to interview young adult, repatriated MKs (n = 9) and those who support them (n = 4). CQR analysis of the MK data resulted in three domains (adjusting to the home country, MK identity and personal growth, and support systems) and 16 core ideas which elaborate on those themes. Separate CQR analysis of the MK supporter interviews resulted in four similar domains (adjustment, identity, relationships, support systems) and 16 core ideas. Our results have been useful in better integrating the foregoing research and in providing suggestions for facilitating positive MK repatriation.

Quantitative results indicated no differences in life roles importance, alcohol use, marital satisfaction, or mental health functioning as a function of time-in-country.

All measures were found to be reliable; have strong test–retest reliability; and moderately to strongly correlate with work meaning, career commitment, and job satisfaction at Time 1 and Time 2. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed mixed evidence concerning the ability of all instruments to load onto one factor. The BCS and CVQ were the best predictors of having a calling, whereas the CS and MCM were the best predictors of work outcomes. The discussion highlights the complexities of each of these instruments in accurately assessing a calling versus a more global, positive work outlook. Recommendations are offered for researchers seeking to study work as a calling.},

We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test a modelof sociocultural adaptation and psychological wellbeing.

Consistent with our hypotheses, interpersonalconnections with host nationals predicted greater sociocultural adaptation (\&beta; = 0.250, p = 0.001) andinterpersonal connections with co‐nationals resulted in poorer psychological adjustment (\&beta; = \&minus;0.171,p = 0.025). Host‐country language proficiency led to better sociocultural adaptation (\&beta; = 0.262, p \&lt;0.001), and perceptions of greater cultural distance had a negative impact on both psychological (\&beta;= 0.314, p \&lt; 0.001) and sociocultural adaptation (\&beta; = 0.328, p \&lt; 0.001).

	abstract = {(from the chapter) Imagine that you are conducting a large online quantitative survey of countertransference management strategies used by therapists in training. In addition to the quantitative measures included in the survey, you decide to add a single open-ended question asking participants to describe components of their unique clinical experiences that were not captured by the measures in the survey (e.g., "How do specific client characteristics or presenting issues relate to your unresolved issues?"). The written responses obtained from your 300 participants contain three or four sentences each and are relatively straightforward and easy to understand. Constructing core ideas as you would for a traditional consensual qualitative research (CQR) analysis seems excessive because the comments are already succinct and there is no context to consider. A briefer alternative to CQR that would produce domains and categories consensually derived from the data would be useful, but you are unsure of how to structure the coding teams, code the data, report the results, or discuss the qualitative findings within the context of the overall study. Fortunately, consensual qualitative research—modified (CQR-M) allows you to do just this task. This chapter provides a brief definition and background of CQR-M followed by a rationale for using CQR-M. We then provide a step-by-step guide to conducting CQR-M analyses. We begin with design considerations, including determining the purpose of the qualitative data and the issue of sample size. Next are steps for data collection, followed by steps for recruiting and training judges. We then describe the procedures for analyzing brief qualitative data, including development of domains and categories, and the consensual coding process. Finally, we provide some guidance for writing up CQR-M results and discussion sections.},

Discriminant validity was evidenced through an absence of relations between the CCSES total score and years of emotional-social counseling experience, emotional social counseling self-efficacy, and research self-efficacy. In addition to the evidence just mentioned, construct validity was supported by increases on the CCSES after a career course and varying levels of efficacy commensurate with status in the field.

A nationally representative sample of 5,670 10th-grade students was followed through 2 yrs beyond high school. Results suggested that sex and race significantly predicted educational and vocational aspirations of students. The educational aspiration model was shown to be more robust than the occupational aspiration model. Overall, students showed increases in educational and occupational aspirations, regardless of sex and race. Compared with other groups, Asian Americans had the greatest increase in educational aspirations. Female students, on the average, had higher educational and vocational aspirations. It is suggested that counseling interventions can be developed to address the school, family and psychological issues for those students who have low aspirations.

This kind of carrying capacity broadens and capacitates international orientation. Ultimately it can only enrich the perspectives that frame our research, practice and consultation, and the problems that face Humanity. Thus, mentoring can include both international scholars who may not have material resources and early career scholars in general, wherever and in whatever material circumstances they may be. Why is it that the people we meet and show International Perspectives in Psychology: Research, Practice, Consultation always, palpably, react with excitement? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that no other journal in psychology has such an ambitious and inspiring goal, or rather, set of goals.

Participants described research use primarily in terms of improving 4-H programs. They discussed their level of confidence (i.e. self-efficacy) in finding and applying research evidence and their beliefs about the outcomes of research utilization (i.e. outcomes expectancy). Participants mentioned such barriers as not knowing where to look for research, lack of time, lack of funding, and difficulty applying research findings to their work. The facilitators included support from other 4-H colleagues and availability of 4-H specific conferences, publications, and curriculum databases.},

Utilizing qualitative methods we interviewed 21 participants (14 leaders, 9 recent 4-H alumni) from 9 states.  Results describe the ways in which participants perceived that the RB (a) supports the four PYD concepts (e.g., “RB fosters independence through the goal setting, monitoring, and appraising process”) and (b) does not support, or should be revised to support the concept (e.g., “RB competitions may hinder mastery”).  Our results support the RB as a PYD intervention but we recommend that states/counties consider these results when revising RBs.  In light of concerns about age and developmental appropriateness, we suggest that the most pressing question is whether or not the traditionally formatted RB is appropriate for all 4-Hers. We encourage RB committees to engage professionals with developmental expertise (e.g., educators) in RB revisions.},

Results of the path analysis explained 56\% of variance in research utilization and 28\% in research utilization self-efficacy.  Among the factors impacting research utilization, self-efficacy played the most important role.  In turn, self-efficacy for research utilization was positively influenced by participants’ learning goal orientation, frequency of 4-H training during the last 12 months, education in research-related areas, and investigative career interests.  In addition, 4-H staff who were exposed to research at higher levels reported higher research utilization self-efficacy.  The findings reinforce the importance of fostering research utilization self-efficacy among 4-H faculty, staff, and volunteers.

Results indicated significantly higher posttest scores for purpose (B ¼ .169, p ¼ .026) and calling (B ¼ .134, p ¼ .013) in the spiritual discernment condition compared to the general adjustment (i.e., control) and traditional career development conditions.

In healthy organizations, culture, climate, and practices create an environment conducive to employee health and safety as well as organizational effectiveness (Lowe, 2010). A healthy organization thus leads to a healthy and successful business (De Smet et al., 2007; Grawitch and Ballard, 2016), underlining the strong link between organizational profitability and workers’ well-being. Starting from a positive perspective focused on success and excellence, the contribution describes how positive organizational health psychology evolved from occupational health psychology to positive occupational health psychology stressing the importance of a primary preventive approach. The focus is not on deficiency and failure but on a positive organizational attitude that proposes interventions at different levels: individual, group, organization, and inter-organization. Healthy organizations need to find the right balance between their particular situation, sector, and culture, highlighting the importance of well-being and sustainability. This contribution discusses also the sustainability of work-life projects and the meaning of work in healthy organizations, stressing the importance of recognizing, respecting, and using the meaning of work as a key for growth and success. Finally, the contribution discusses new research and intervention opportunities for healthy organizations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Harmony results at three main points, with oneself, with others, and with nature/the natural world, also taking into account the spatial and temporal perspectives. The Psychology of harmony as harmonization represents a pillar for a new research area in the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development, considering harmonization in geographical and temporal perspectives, including meaningful construction processes from the past, to the present, and into the future using reflexivity processes at the individual, group, community, social, and national levels.

Founded in social cognitive career theory, the Self-Efficacy for Sociocultural Adaptation Scale (SESCAS) is a multidimensional scale that assesses self-efficacy for three types of tasks (affective, behavioral, cognitive) in two cultural contexts (environmental, interpersonal). We conducted item-total correlations, confirmatory factor analyses, reliability analyses (test-retest, internal consistency), within-scale convergent and discriminant validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and predictive validity assessments across an initial sample of the general population (n = 227), a cross-validation sample of undergraduate students enrolled in education abroad (n = 546), and a predictive validity sample of re-entered education abroad undergraduates (n = 74). Psychometric properties of the scale support its use as a total score and as various subfactor constellations. Researchers are encouraged to use the SESCAS to explore how self-efficacy for sociocultural adaptation may contribute to global learning outcomes and well-being.},

	abstract = {Despite unprecedented access to information and diffusion of knowledge across the globe, the bulk of work in mainstream psychological science still reflects and promotes the interests of a privileged minority of people in affluent centers of the modern global order. Compared to other social science disciplines, there are few critical voices who reflect on the Euro-American colonial character of psychological science, particularly its relationship to ongoing processes of domination that facilitate growth for a privileged minority but undermine sustainability for the global majority. Moved by mounting concerns about ongoing forms of multiple oppression (including racialized violence, economic injustice, unsustainable over-development, and ecological damage), we proposed a special thematic section and issued a call for papers devoted to the topic of "decolonizing psychological science". In this introduction to the special section, we first discuss two perspectives—liberation psychology and cultural psychology—that have informed our approach to the topic. We then discuss manifestations of coloniality in psychological science and describe three approaches to decolonization—indigenization, accompaniment, and denaturalization—that emerge from contributions to the special section. We conclude with an invitation to readers to submit their own original contributions to an ongoing effort to create an online collection of digitally linked articles on the topic of decolonizing psychological science.},

	abstract = {Two groups of male inmates (n = 31, n = 31) participated in the Positive Re-Entry in Corrections Program (PRCP). This positive psychology intervention focused on teaching offenders skills that facilitate re-entry into the community. Offenders participated in weekly lectures, discussions, and homework assignments focused on positive psychology principles. The two groups differed in duration of treatment (8 weeks and 12 weeks). Participants completed pre- and post-intervention measures of gratitude, hope, and life satisfaction. Using a 2 × 2 mixed design ANOVA, we hypothesized that the intervention (with two between-subjects levels of 8 and 12 weeks) and duration (with two repeated measures levels of pre and post) of treatment would moderate pre- to post-intervention change. Results indicated significant differences on pre- and post-intervention scores for both groups of offenders on all measures. The analysis did not yield statistically significant differences between groups, demonstrating no additive benefits from the inclusion of four additional sessions, thus saving time and money for correctional programming and funding. This research supports the use of positive psychology in prison interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},
