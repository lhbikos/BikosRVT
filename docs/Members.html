<h1>Faculty Advisor: Lynette H. Bikos, PhD, ABPP</h1>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education: BA, University of Missouri-Columbia, 1987; MA, University
of Missouri-Columbia, 1989; PhD, University of Kansas-Lawrence, 1996. At
SPU since 2005.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">
<p><br> Dr. Lynette Bikos (she/her/hers, pronounced “bike-us”) teaches
statistics, research methods, and psychometrics courses in the Clinical
and Industrial-Organizational Psychology doctoral programs at Seattle
Pacific University. She is a licensed psychologist in Washington and
Kansas and Board Certified in Counseling Psychology. Her scholarship
falls at the intersections of vocational, global, and sustainable
psychology. <br></p>
<p>At this particular time in SPU’s history, Dr. Bikos has been engaged
in advocacy regarding the policies and practices that result in
employment discrimination for members of the LGBTQIA+ community. She is
PI and co-PI on two studies regarding the campus climate and the
sustainability of protest. She has has also been involved in
coordinating events designed to cultivate a community that characterized
by affirmation and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>Dr. Bikos’ first love is career development. At SPU Dr. Bikos engaged
in both the science and practice of vocational psychology by providing
clinical supervision for the Graduate Career Advisors at SPU’s Center
for Center for Career and Calling and in their work as facilitators for
<em>CALLED! SPU’s Online Field Guide</em> (OFG; Canvas edition).
Dr. Bikos is the PI of a random clinical trial evaluating differences
between three versions of the OFG – particularly looking to see if the
calling-infused version contributes to vocational outcomes
over-and-above adjustment-to-college and traditional-career-planning
versions. <br></p>
<p>Dr. Bikos is particularly interested in understanding how individuals
respond to change – plotting longitudinal growth trajectories examining
the simultaneous effects of individual and contextual factors.
Significant research projects have explored global learning outcomes in
returnees from study abroad, first year adaptation of expatriate
spouses, and career development in response to the OFG. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, she is investigating experiences of and attitudes
toward making(sewing) and wearing cloth facemasks. Whether in a
videoconference or around a table, planning, implementing, analyzing,
and discovering with her advisees is one of her greatest joys. <br></p>

completed a 3-year term (2019-2021) as Vice President for Engagement in
APA’s Division 52/International Psychology.</p>
<p>Dr. Bikos’ commitment to global begins at home. Her family has hosted
more than a dozen exchange students (and teachers). She is an avid
bicycle commuter, running errands, going to the Y, and riding
to-and-from campus (excepting for ice and wind). She also spends a fair
amount of time experimenting the kitchen – particularly with
international recipes and ingredients.</p>

<p><strong>Keyera Gaulden</strong> (she/her/hers, ~27) is from Kitsap
County, WA. After high school graduation, she moved to Montana where she
competed in track and field for the University of Montana, finding her
passion for psychology. She received her Bachelor of Science in
Psychology with a minor in Criminal Justice from Washington State
University in December 2021. Keyera was admitted to Seattle Pacific
University’s Clinical Doctoral program the following year, February
2022. During her undergraduate studies, she researched civil movements
for missing and murdered indigenous women, domestic violence as well as
the Me Too, and Black Lives Matter movements. Along with research, she
was heavily involved in boots-on-the-ground work, protesting,
campaigning, and implementing programs for Kitsap County’s only state
certified domestic violence agency. The last program implemented prior
to grad school is the Recovery Navigator Program (disseminated by Salish
Behavioral Health Services Organizations), designed to divert
individuals experiencing substance use disorder and co-occurring mental
health crisis from law enforcement and emergency room usage. Shortly
before beginning her doctoral program at SPU, Keyera squeezed in a
project, appointed to the Washington Corrections Center for Women; she
vigorously worked to turn the Prison Pet Partnership Program around. She
is now researching activism and burnout as they pertain to SPU’s
LGBTQIA+ community, as well as prevention and legal advocacy for King
County Sexual Assault Resource Center. As she expands in the realm of
psychology and criminal justice, she continuously works for equal rights
and justice for all through Prison Pet Partnership Program reform on
their Reentry Committee, and for the Foundation for Homeless and
Poverty; as they strive to flip generational curses and increase
opportunity and success for all. She plans to connect mental health to
these studies and the need for growth in psychologists, as well as
clinical best practices.</p>

<p><strong>Ashley Righetti</strong> (she/her, ~‘26) is from Washington
State and completed her bachelor’s degree at the University of
Washington Tacoma prior to attending Seattle Pacific University to
pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology. During her undergraduate career,
Ashley researched students’ self-care practices in relation to academic
achievement while looking at facets of psychological well-being as
mediating factors. Upon graduating, she stepped away from school in
order to consider other pursuits, which is where she developed a
new-found interest in aspects of vocational psychology. In particular,
she is hoping to eventually investigate the work environment, self-care
practices, and how individual’s psychological health is affected.
Ashley’s MRP project is focused on mask-wearing in relation to affect
while taking into account geopolitical context and COVID-19 practices.
When Ashley is not in class or doing schoolwork, she is usually at the
gym training in weightlifting. Her goal in the sport is to eventually
qualify for the North American Open Finals while also being a full-time
student.</p>

<p><strong>Linda Montaño, M. A.</strong> (she/her, ~‘23) is a Pacific
Northwest transplant who has lived in Texas, Indiana, Michigan, and
Ohio. She’s a doctoral student in the industrial-organizational
psychology program. Linda earned her BA in Business Administration from
Hope College in Holland, Michigan and MA in Public Policy and Management
from the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at The Ohio State
University. Having worked in a wide variety of settings and roles, Linda
credits the children, families, caseworkers and wider network of
Children’s Protective Services in Austin, Texas with the most formative
experiences of her life. Immediately prior to coming to SPU, Linda
worked at The Ohio State University where she served as interim
assistant vice provost for global strategies and international affairs
and senior director of business operations and administration. A
serendipitous meeting with Dr. Bikos at the Forum on Education Abroad in
2018 propelled Linda to apply to SPU, the I-O program, and ultimately
landed her in Dr. Bikos’ RVT. Within her doctoral research team, Linda
is investigating maskmaking (sewing cloth facemasks) during the pandemic
in light of work as calling theory (WCT, Duffy et al., 2018).
Additionally, she is analyzing student responses to initial efforts at
decolonizing a graduate statistics course. Linda’s research interests
are in topics related to decent work, job crafting, and
industrial/organizational psychology. Linda greatly enjoys being a
student, riding Washington state ferries, hiking on beaches, hugging
trees, and curling up with a good book on rainy PNW days.</p>

<p><strong>Jamie Layton, M.S.</strong> (she/her/hers; ~’24) was born and
raised in Oregon. She moved down to California for college and received
her Bachelors of Arts in Psychology with a minor in Spanish at Biola
University in 2017. Jamie joined our team in 2018 as a member of the
clinical Psychology program. After her three years in California Jamie
was hoping to stay in the PNW for grad school and was excited at all of
the opportunities both recreationally and clinically that Seattle had to
offer. Jamie is interested in pursuing trauma work and highly values
multicultural work and serving underserved populations. Her Mentored
Research Project (MRP) examined the effect that religious engagement had
on trauma experiences and PTSD symptoms in a sample of Somali refugees.
For her dissertation she is using data from our partnership with King
County Sexual Assault Resource Center to evaluate the moderating effect
of secondary victimization on the relationship between resilience and
sexual assault coping self-efficacy. Clinically, Jamie has had practicum
placements at the Olympia Fire Department, Washington Correction Center
for Women, Seattle Children’s Hospital’s OCD Intensive Outpatient
Program, Western State Hospital, Refugees Northwest, and The Affirmative
Collective. Outside of school Jamie enjoys cooking, baking, listening to
podcasts and audio books, playing board games, and going to Mariners and
hockey games.</p>
