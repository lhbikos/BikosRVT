<h1>Faculty Advisor: Lynette H. Bikos, PhD, ABPP</h1>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Education: BA, University of Missouri-Columbia, 1987; MA, University
of Missouri-Columbia, 1989; PhD, University of Kansas-Lawrence, 1996. At
SPU since 2005.</p>
<div class = "row">
<div class="col-md-8">
<p><br> Dr. Lynette Bikos (she/her/hers, pronounced “bike-us”) teaches
statistics, research methods, and psychometrics courses in the Clinical
and Industrial-Organizational Psychology doctoral programs at Seattle
Pacific University. She is a licensed psychologist in Washington and
Kansas and Board Certified in Counseling Psychology. Her scholarship
falls at the intersections of vocational, global, and sustainable
psychology. <br></p>
<p>At this particular time in SPU’s history, Dr. Bikos has been engaged
in advocacy regarding the policies and practices that result in
employment discrimination for members of the LGBTQIA+ community. She is
PI and co-PI on two studies regarding the campus climate and the
sustainability of protest. She has has also been involved in
coordinating events designed to cultivate a community that characterized
by affirmation and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>Dr. Bikos’ first love is career development. At SPU Dr. Bikos engaged
in both the science and practice of vocational psychology by providing
clinical supervision for the Graduate Career Advisors at SPU’s Center
for Center for Career and Calling and in their work as facilitators for
<em>CALLED! SPU’s Online Field Guide</em> (OFG; Canvas edition).
Dr. Bikos is the PI of a random clinical trial evaluating differences
between three versions of the OFG – particularly looking to see if the
calling-infused version contributes to vocational outcomes
over-and-above adjustment-to-college and traditional-career-planning
versions. <br></p>
<p>Dr. Bikos is particularly interested in understanding how individuals
respond to change – plotting longitudinal growth trajectories examining
the simultaneous effects of individual and contextual factors.
Significant research projects have explored global learning outcomes in
returnees from study abroad, first year adaptation of expatriate
spouses, and career development in response to the OFG. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, she is investigating experiences of and attitudes
toward making(sewing) and wearing cloth facemasks. Whether in a
videoconference or around a table, planning, implementing, analyzing,
and discovering with her advisees is one of her greatest joys. <br></p>

in Northern California. She moved to Southern California and attended
California State University, Fullerton, where she received her Bachelor
of Arts in Psychology with a minor in Adolescent Development in 2021.
Throughout her time as an undergraduate, Kiana competed as a Division I
athlete in the sport of track and field, served on the Academic Senate,
and worked in a research lab. Her undergraduate research was focused on
rehabilitation for community-dwelling survivors of traumatic brain
injury, COVID-19 psychological distress, and sexual assault in the
military. She is interested in trauma work, serving underserved
populations, and working in multidisciplinary settings. Currently, Kiana
is working on projects dedicated to recentering statistics, revising the
Online Field Guide (OFG) to be more inclusive, and conducting
longitudinal work with the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center.
She works in the Center for Career and Calling at SPU as a Graduate
Career Advisor, where she assists undergraduate students pursue their

<p><strong>Clara (Thea) O’Brien</strong> (she/her/hers, ~’26) is
originally from Western Washington and moved to Seattle to pursue her
doctoral degree in clinical psychology at SPU. She earned her BA in
psychology from Pacific Lutheran University in 2015, where she conducted
qualitative and quantitative research on children’s trust in adult
testimony of healthfulness of foods. She has since spent time working in
higher education as an academic coordinator at the University of Idaho
before spending time in Europe travelling and volunteering in refugee
aid. This is where she developed a passion for crisis care and acute
interventions. She then went on to work in outpatient mental health
serving adults suffering from SMI for three and a half years. This
sparked her desire to pursue a higher degree in clinical psychology. She
is interested in trauma work and acute care as it relates to underserved
populations. For her Mentored Research Project she is studying the
effects of affect and stigma on Mask-Wearing behaviors during the
COVID-19 pandemic. These are being examined in the context of COVID-19
infection rates as well as geopolitical context. She works as a Graduate
Career Advisor in the Center for Career and Calling at SPU assisting
undergraduate students in their career goals. In her free time, she
enjoys drinking tea, listening to vinyl records, and backpacking.

<p><strong>Ashley Righetti</strong> (she/her, ~‘26) is from Washington
State and completed her bachelor’s degree at the University of
Washington Tacoma prior to attending Seattle Pacific University to
pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology. During her undergraduate career,
Ashley researched students’ self-care practices in relation to academic
achievement while looking at facets of psychological well-being as
mediating factors. Upon graduating, she stepped away from school in
order to consider other pursuits, which is where she developed a
new-found interest in aspects of vocational psychology. In particular,
she is hoping to eventually investigate the work environment, self-care
practices, and how individual’s psychological health is affected.
Ashley’s MRP project is focused on mask-wearing in relation to affect
while taking into account geopolitical context and COVID-19 practices.
When Ashley is not in class or doing schoolwork, she is usually at the
gym training in weightlifting. Her goal in the sport is to eventually
qualify for the North American Open Finals while also being a full-time
student.</p>

of her life. Immediately prior to coming to SPU, Linda worked at The
Ohio State University where she served as interim assistant vice provost
for global strategies and international affairs and senior director of
business operations and administration. A serendipitous meeting with
Dr. Bikos at the Forum on Education Abroad in 2018 propelled Linda to
apply to SPU, the I-O program, and ultimately landed her in Dr. Bikos’
RVT. Within her doctoral research team, Linda is investigating
maskmaking (sewing cloth facemasks) during the pandemic in light of work
as calling theory (WCT, Duffy et al., 2018). Additionally, she is
analyzing student responses to initial efforts at decolonizing a
graduate statistics course. Linda’s research interests are in topics
related to decent work, job crafting, and industrial/organizational
psychology. Linda greatly enjoys being a student, riding Washington
state ferries, hiking on beaches, hugging trees, and curling up with a
good book on rainy PNW days.</p>

<p><strong>Jamie Layton</strong> (she/her/hers; ~’24) was born and
raised in Oregon. She moved down to California for college and received
her Bachelors of Arts in Psychology with a minor in Spanish at Biola
University in 2017. Jamie joined our team in 2018 as a member of the
clinical Psychology program. After her three years in California Jamie
was hoping to stay in the PNW for grad school and was excited at all of
the opportunities both recreationally and clinically that Seattle had to
offer. Jamie is interested in pursing trauma work and highly values
multicultural work and serving underserved populations. Her Mentored
Research Project (MRP) examined the effect that religious engagement had
on trauma experiences and PTSD symptoms in a sample of Somali refugees.
For her dissertation she is hoping to use our new King County Sexual
Assault Resource Center prevention project. While the exact details are
still being worked out one possibility would be to psychometrically
validate a consent scale for middle and high school students as we are
unaware of any consent scale that currently exists for people this
young. Clinically, Jamie has had a practicum placement at Olympia Fire
Department where she went on calls and provided milieu therapy to
Olympia firefighters, and also provided individual therapy to
firefighters and family members throughout all of Thurston County. In
addition to her research, classes, and clinical work, Jamie is a stats
