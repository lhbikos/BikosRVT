<br>
Dr. Lynette Bikos (she/her/hers, pronounced "bike-us") teaches statistics, research methods, and psychometrics courses in the Clinical and Industrial-Organizational Psychology doctoral programs at Seattle Pacific University. She is a licensed psychologist in Washington and Kansas and Board Certified in Counseling Psychology.  Her expertise falls at the intersections of vocational, global, and sustainable psychology. <br>

Dr. Bikos’ first love is career development.  At SPU Dr. Bikos engaged in both the science and practice of vocational psychology by providing clinical supervision for the Graduate Career Advisors at SPU’s Center for Center for Career and Calling and in their work as facilitators for *CALLED!  SPU’s Online Field Guide* (OFG; Canvas edition).  Dr. Bikos is the Principal Investigator of a random clinical trial evaluating differences between three versions of the OFG – particularly looking to see if the calling-infused version contributes to vocational outcomes over-and-above adjustment-to-college and traditional-career-planning versions. <br>

Dr. Bikos is particularly interested in understanding how individuals respond to change -- plotting longitudinal growth trajectories examining the simultaneous effects of individual and contextual factors.  Significant research projects have explored global learning outcomes in returnees from study abroad, first year adaptation of expatriate spouses, and career development in response to the OFG.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, she is investigating experiences of and attitudes toward making(sewing) and wearing cloth facemasks.  Whether in a videoconference or around a table, planning, implementing, analyzing, and discovering with her advisees is one of her greatest joys. <br>

She is currently holding a 3-year term (2019-2021) as Vice President for Engagement in APA’s Division 52/International Psychology.

Dr. Bikos’ commitment to global begins at home. Her family has hosted more than a dozen exchange students (and teachers). She is an avid bicycle commuter, accruing over 2,000 miles annually in her trek to-and-from campus. She also spends a fair amount of time experimenting the kitchen – particularly with international recipes and ingredients.

**Clara (Thea) O’Brien** (she/her/hers, ~'26) is originally from Western Washington and moved to Seattle to pursue her doctoral degree in clinical psychology at SPU. She earned her BA in psychology from Pacific Lutheran University in 2015, where she conducted qualitative and quantitative research on children’s trust in adult testimony of healthfulness of foods. She has since spent time working in higher education as an academic coordinator at the University of Idaho before spending time in Europe travelling and volunteering in refugee aid. This is where she developed a passion for crisis care and acute interventions. She then went on to work in outpatient mental health serving adults suffering from SMI for three and a half years. This sparked her desire to pursue a higher degree in clinical psychology. She is interested in trauma work and acute care as it relates to underserved populations. For her Mentored Research Project she is studying the effects of affect and stigma on Mask-Wearing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are being examined in the context of COVID-19 infection rates as well as geopolitical context. She works as a Graduate Career Advisor in the Center for Career and Calling at SPU assisting undergraduate students in their career goals. In her free time, she enjoys drinking tea, listening to vinyl records, and backpacking. Pre-pandemic she is an avid concert and museum attender.

**Ashley Righetti** (she/her, ~'26) is from Washington State and completed her bachelor’s degree at the University of Washington Tacoma prior to attending Seattle Pacific University to pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology. During her undergraduate career, Ashley researched students’ self-care practices in relation to academic achievement while looking at facets of psychological well-being as mediating factors. Upon graduating, she stepped away from school in order to consider other pursuits, which is where she developed a new-found interest in aspects of vocational psychology. In particular, she is hoping to eventually investigate the work environment, self-care practices, and how individual’s psychological health is affected. Ashley’s MRP project is focused on mask-wearing in relation to affect while taking into account geopolitical context and COVID-19 practices. When Ashley is not in class or doing schoolwork, she is usually at the gym training in weightlifting. Her goal in the sport is to eventually qualify for the North American Open Finals while also being a full-time student.

**Linda Montaño** (she/her, ~'23) is a Pacific Northwest transplant who has lived in Texas, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio.  She’s a doctoral student in the industrial-organizational psychology program.  Linda earned her BA in Business Administration from Hope College in Holland, Michigan and MA in Public Policy and Management from the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University. Having worked in a wide variety of settings and roles, Linda credits the children, families, caseworkers and wider network of Children’s Protective Services in Austin, Texas with the most formative experiences of her life.  Immediately prior to coming to SPU, Linda worked at The Ohio State University where she served as interim assistant vice provost for global strategies and international affairs and senior director of business operations and administration.  A serendipitous meeting with Dr. Bikos at the Forum on Education Abroad in 2018 propelled Linda to apply to SPU, the I-O program, and ultimately landed her in Dr. Bikos’ RVT.  Within her doctoral research team, Linda is investigating maskmaking (sewing cloth facemasks) during the pandemic in light of work as calling theory (WCT, Duffy et al., 2018).  Additionally, she is analyzing student responses to initial efforts at decolonizing a graduate statistics course.  Linda’s research interests are in topics related to decent work, job crafting, and industrial/organizational psychology.  Linda greatly enjoys being a student, riding Washington state ferries, hiking on beaches, hugging trees, and curling up with a good book on rainy PNW days.

**Jamie Layton** (she/her/hers; ~’24) was born and raised in Oregon. She moved down to California for college and received her Bachelors of Arts in Psychology with a  minor in Spanish at Biola University in 2017. Jamie joined our team in 2018 as a member of the clinical Psychology program. After her three years in California Jamie was hoping to stay in the PNW for grad school and was excited at all of the opportunities both recreationally and clinically that Seattle had to offer. Jamie is interested in pursing trauma work and highly values multicultural work and serving underserved populations. Her Mentored Research Project (MRP) examined the effect that religious engagement had on trauma experiences and PTSD symptoms in a sample of Somali refugees. For her dissertation she is hoping to use our new King County Sexual Assault Resource Center prevention project. While the exact details are still being worked out one possibility would be to psychometrically validate a consent scale for middle and high school students as we are unaware of any consent scale that currently exists for people this young. Clinically, Jamie has had a practicum placement at Olympia Fire Department where she went on calls and provided milieu therapy to Olympia firefighters, and also provided individual therapy to firefighters and family members throughout all of Thurston County. In addition to her research, classes, and clinical work, Jamie is a stats TA for the program. Outside of school Jamie enjoy cooking, baking, listening to podcasts and audio books, playing board games, and going to Mariners and hockey games.
