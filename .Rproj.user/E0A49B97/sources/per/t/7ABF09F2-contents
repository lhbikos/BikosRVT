The psychology of sustainability and sustainable development [@di_fabio_opening_2018; @di_fabio_positive_2017; @di_fabio_psychology_2017; @di_fabio_psychology_2018] (a) focuses on well-being; (b) at levels of interaction including those of individuals, groups, organizations, and systems; and (c) is concerned with processes that are robust, consistent, and enduring. In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on avoidance (exploitation, depletion, irreversible alteration), the PSSD approach focuses on promotion (enrichment, growth, and flexible change). In this way, *sustainable* psychology may have (surprisingly) less to do with *what* is studied and more to do with the attitudes and approaches to studying it.  In the context of the Bikos RVT, you will likely recognize overlaps with *vocational* (e.g., "Is it reasonable to frame maskmaking during the pandemic as calling?") and *global* (e.g., "How does geopolitical context influence attitudes toware mask-wearing?") psychology. <br>

As the U.S. was coming to terms with the seriousness of the pandemic, we launched a pair of studies that focus on facemasks. Both were 12 to 24 wave, longitudinal studies. <br>

# #MaskMadness 
</div>
<br>

The unique focus of #MaskMadness is about wearing facemasks.  Specifically, we are assessing reaction to seeing others' in facemasks and the experiences of wearing the facemasks in public.  Meta-data that is collected in Qualtrics has allowed us to collect contextual information (e.g., voting trends, weekly rates of positive COVID tests and COVID-related deaths) to see how they interact with individual factors (e.g., job loss) to predict health and safety practices around COVID (e.g., social distancing, hand-washing, wearing facemasks) and well-being. <br>

"Maskmaker" (yes, a play on "Matchmaker Matchmaker" from *Fiddler on the Roof*) augmented the #MaskMadness study with its focus on those sewing cloth facemasks. Maskmakers were asked to report their weekly productivity as well as reflect on why they engaged in maskmaking and how it was going.

The I/O students in a summer qualitative research methods class analyzed the data and found that it fit well to the work-as-calling theory [@duffy_work_2018]. We are presently analyzing quantitative data to see if it will map similarly.

# Recent Presentations<br>

</div>
<br>

At WPA 2022 we contributed three presentations to the symposium title, "The On-and-Off-Again of Facemasks in the COVID-19 Pandemic." The first two presentations focused on [maskmaking, analyzing it against the work-as-calling theory](https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=52f4bcf5-95fd-4d86-8698-ae7f011c22ff). The second presentation examined the [effects of facemask-wearing stigma and geopolitical context on well-being](https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ca4b65a4-395e-43a1-ae56-ae7d0113a907)

At WPA 2021(Virtual) we provided a symposium presentation (only 17 minutes) summarizing the qualitative data from the [MaskMaker study](https://spu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=30261721-8835-442e-b5ba-acfd011c2eef). It fit well to the work-as-calling theory.
