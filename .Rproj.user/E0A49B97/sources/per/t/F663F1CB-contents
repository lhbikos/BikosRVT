<br>
Dr. Lynette Bikos (she/her/hers, pronounced "bike-us") teaches statistics, research methods, and psychometrics courses in the Clinical and Industrial-Organizational Psychology doctoral programs at Seattle Pacific University. She is a licensed psychologist in Washington and Kansas and Board Certified in Counseling Psychology.  Her scholarship falls at the intersections of vocational, global, and sustainable psychology. <br>

At this particular time in SPU's history, Dr. Bikos has been engaged in advocacy regarding the policies and practices that result in employment discrimination for members of the LGBTQIA+ community. She is PI and co-PI on two studies regarding the campus climate and the sustainability of protest. She has has also been involved in coordinating events designed to cultivate a community that characterized by affirmation and inclusiveness.

Dr. Bikos’ first love is career development.  At SPU Dr. Bikos engaged in both the science and practice of vocational psychology by providing clinical supervision for the Graduate Career Advisors at SPU’s Center for Center for Career and Calling and in their work as facilitators for *CALLED! SPU’s Online Field Guide* (OFG; Canvas edition).  Dr. Bikos is the PI of a random clinical trial evaluating differences between three versions of the OFG – particularly looking to see if the calling-infused version contributes to vocational outcomes over-and-above adjustment-to-college and traditional-career-planning versions. <br>

Dr. Bikos is particularly interested in understanding how individuals respond to change -- plotting longitudinal growth trajectories examining the simultaneous effects of individual and contextual factors.  Significant research projects have explored global learning outcomes in returnees from study abroad, first year adaptation of expatriate spouses, and career development in response to the OFG.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, she is investigating experiences of and attitudes toward making(sewing) and wearing cloth facemasks.  Whether in a videoconference or around a table, planning, implementing, analyzing, and discovering with her advisees is one of her greatest joys. <br>

In the larger profession of psychology, Dr. Bikos serves on the editorial boards of the *Journal of Vocational Behavior*, *Career Development Quarterly*, and *International Perspectives in Psychology:  Research, Practice, Consultation*; and has previously served on the *Journal of Counseling Psychology* and *Journal of Career Development* editorial boards.  She is a Fellow in both the American Psychological Association (Division 17/Society of Counseling Psychology; Division 52/International Psychology) and the Western Psychological Association. She recently completed a 3-year term (2019-2021) as Vice President for Engagement in APA’s Division 52/International Psychology.

Dr. Bikos’ commitment to global begins at home. Her family has hosted more than a dozen exchange students (and teachers). She is an avid bicycle commuter, running errands, going to the Y, and riding to-and-from campus (excepting for ice and wind). She also spends a fair amount of time experimenting the kitchen – particularly with international recipes and ingredients.

**Keyera Gaulden** (she/her/hers, ~26) is from Kitsap County, WA. After high school graduation, she moved to Montana where she competed in track and field for the University of Montana, finding her passion for psychology. She received her Bachelor of Science in Psychology with a minor in Criminal Justice from Washington State University in December 2021. Keyera was admitted to Seattle Pacific University’s Clinical Doctoral program the following year, February 2022. During her undergraduate studies, she researched civil movements for missing and murdered indigenous women, domestic violence as well as the Me Too, and Black Lives Matter movements. Along with research, she was heavily involved in boots-on-the-ground work, protesting, campaigning, and implementing programs for Kitsap County’s only state certified domestic violence agency. The last program implemented prior to grad school is the Recovery Navigator Program (disseminated by Salish Behavioral Health Services Organizations), designed to divert individuals experiencing substance use disorder and co-occurring mental health crisis from law enforcement and emergency room usage. Shortly before beginning her doctoral program at SPU, Keyera squeezed in a project, appointed to the Washington Corrections Center for Women; she vigorously worked to turn the Prison Pet Partnership Program around. She is now researching activism and burnout as they pertain to SPU’s LGBTQIA+ community, as well as prevention and legal advocacy for King County Sexual Assault Resource Center. As she expands in the realm of psychology and criminal justice, she continuously works for equal rights and justice for all through Prison Pet Partnership Program reform on their Reentry Committee, and for the Foundation for Homeless and Poverty; as they strive to flip generational curses and increase opportunity and success for all. She plans to connect mental health to these studies and the need for growth in psychologists, as well as clinical best practices.

**Ashley Righetti** (she/her, ~'26) is from Washington State and completed her bachelor’s degree at the University of Washington Tacoma prior to attending Seattle Pacific University to pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology. During her undergraduate career, Ashley researched students’ self-care practices in relation to academic achievement while looking at facets of psychological well-being as mediating factors. Upon graduating, she stepped away from school in order to consider other pursuits, which is where she developed a new-found interest in aspects of vocational psychology. In particular, she is hoping to eventually investigate the work environment, self-care practices, and how individual’s psychological health is affected. Ashley’s MRP project is focused on mask-wearing in relation to affect while taking into account geopolitical context and COVID-19 practices. When Ashley is not in class or doing schoolwork, she is usually at the gym training in weightlifting. Her goal in the sport is to eventually qualify for the North American Open Finals while also being a full-time student.
