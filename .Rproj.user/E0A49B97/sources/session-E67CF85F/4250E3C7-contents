The purpose of the research vertical team (RVT) is two-fold.  First, it is the primary venue in which students develop research skills and engage in research projects.  Second, it is the context in which the student most regularly interacts with their primary faculty advisor, and thus should be considered to serve an advisory function beyond research training. <br><br>

# RVT Purpose <br>
</div>


## Professionalism<br>

* All members of the department of clinical psychology are expected to demonstrate professional competence and courtesy. This includes, for example, holding ourselves to high standards, being collegial towards each other, and taking RVT responsibilities seriously. <br><br>

## RVT Meetings<br>

<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-8">

* RVT meets on Wednesdays (8:00 - 11am) when academic terms (all four quarters) are in session. Although you should reserve all three hours, we have a project management orientation where teams are simultaneously and sequentially scheduled during that period.
* The RVT meets in a Microsoft TEAMS environment. The screenshot shows a common Wednesday morning when a couple of project groups are meeting and others are hanging out in "Study Hall" -- a place and time for dedicated, individual, work (like a writing accountability group).
* Plan for an additional 5-7 hours per week of work. More time may be needed when preparing for conferences and/or publication. Students are expected to work on their projects outside of RVT meetings, as most of the time is often spent on project updates.
* Attendance at each meeting is required – in fact you are enrolled in RVT (i.e., “research and dissertation”) as a course throughout the program. 
* We move through the agenda quickly, so be prepared with assignments, questions, and topics for discussion in advance.<br><br>

## Contributing to the RVT in General<br>

* All RVT members are expected to contribute to ongoing RVT projects.  Typical contributions include literature searches, article summaries, and annotated bibliographies; data collection; data entry, cleaning, and analysis; and editing manuscripts, grant proposals, and conference presentations.
* We embrace a pay it forward attitude – newer team members assist with dissertation (and other) projects of more senior members. 
* You can expect to both get and give professional feedback in this RVT—this is an essential part of your development as a clinician and researcher. <br><br>

## Bikos’ Idiosyncrasies<br>
* Somewhat obsessed with details such as mastery of APA style, the use of hanging indents in MSWord, finding R packages that make beautiful tables and figures, and getting Qualtrics surveys to do the heavy lifting. 
* Expects quick turnaround on e-mail correspondence. Advisees should check SPU e-mail 3X/day (more frequently during active projects).
* Seeks to create a "pay it all around" culture in the team.
* Bike/bus commuter. Love treats (particularly chocolate…but also super healthy ones) and sometimes brings them to RVT. 
* Is consistently amazed by the caliber of the character and brilliance of our students and considers it a gift to be in this work.
* Students who excel in the Bikos team seek out learning opportunities, are critical thinkers (and reviewers), and enjoy the other members of the team. <br><br>

# Typical RVT Trajectory <br>
</div>
## Year 1 <br>

*	Attend weekly RVT meetings
*	Start the MRP (mentored research project)
  - Conduct the literature review
  - Create a "mangy cat outline"
  - Propose (in writing and formal presentation) the method
  - Scrub and score data
  - Obtain prelimniary results
*	Join older cohort students in existing projects
* Engage in the one or more of the professional service activities of the BikosRVT <br><br>

## Year 2 <br>

*	Complete MRP
*	Present a project as a poster or paper at non-SPU conference (WPA, APA, or specialty conference) AND volunteer in some capacity at the conference (networking!).
*	Be working on a manuscript (like the MRP) that will be submitted for publication
*	Assume leadership role within the RVT by shepherding newer members and leading/co-leading an RVT project

## Year 3 <br>
-	Co-author a manuscript that is submitted & accepted for publication.  
-	Co-review (for a journal on which Dr. Bikos is an editorial board member) two manuscripts.
-	Write your dissertation proposal; have it approved before the June 30th deadline

## Year 4 and/or 5 <br>
-	Collect and analyze dissertation data
-	Defend dissertation before leaving for internship <br><br>

*Prior to applying for internship (fall, year 4 or 5), your goal is to have 2-3 professional presentations, 1-2 co-authored publications, 2 co-peer-reviews, and leadership experience.* <br><br>

## Year 5 and/or 6 <br>

*	Internship.
*	Defend dissertation (if not previously completed).
*	Pop into the virtual team meeting every once in awhile to keep us apprised of life on the other side of the doctoral program. Your peer advising is valuable to our team.

*It is not uncommon for students to add a year dedicated to enhancing experiences in clinical and research skills.*
