Beginning with the development and evaluation of a Job Search Club for International Students [@bikos_job_1999], created during her pre-doctoral internship, extending into expatriation/repatriation, and more recently on education abroad, Dr. Bikos has long held interests in global psychology. She is particularly interested in how people transition into culturally diverse contexts. These are examples of recently published projects -- each of which have a well of unexplored data. <br>

While this page is labeled *global* psychology, the majority of our projects have overlap with *vocational* (e.g., "How does study abroad impact one's sense of calling or strength of vocational identity?" and "Does one's self-efficacy for sociocultural adaptation map onto a prominent career theory?") and *sustainable* (e.g., "How does a culturally dislocating experience impact one's worldview or global learning?" psychology).  Methodologically, the projects below reflect Dr. Bikos' love of longitudinal/repeated measures ("How do people change in response to transitions?") and psychometrics. <br>

# GLO Abroad <br>

GLOabroad.  In June 2009 our RVT launched a mixed methods (i.e., qualitative and quantitative), longitudinal, investigation of the psycho-social-spiritual-educational outcomes of SPU students who are travelling internationally for traditional study abroad and faith-based global service learning. We assessed the students 3 months prior to departure, and then 2-weeks, 6-weeks, 3-months, 6-months, 9-months, and 12-months after their reentry. Presently, we have data from around 270 SPU international immersion learning students (and a control group of 70 students who did not travel internationally. <br>

Liz Dykhouse's ('16) doctoral dissertation found some of the first evidence of what some have termed "re-entry shock."  Given the mild-to-moderate trough and return to baseline within a year, we encourage education abroad advisors to offer training in coping skills during the program, to frame any re-entry struggles "re-entry friction," and encourage individual exploration during this time.

Rebekah Forman's ('14) doctoral dissertation was the creation and evaluation of a scale that assesses self-efficacy for sociocultural adaptation. The flexible scale can examine self-efficacy along environmental and interpersonal contexts; affective, behavioral, or cognitive tasks; as a combination of those two factors (e.g., affective tasks in the interpersonal context).
