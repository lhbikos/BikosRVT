# CALLED!  SPU's Online Field Guide
</div>
<div class = "row">
<br>

While this page is labeled *vocational* psychology, it often feels impossible to disaggregate our projects into discrete categories.  For example, examining calling in a sample of students engaged in global service learning and examining the career development needs of repatriated missionary kids include strong *global* elements. From an applied/program development perspective, the creation of SPU's Online Field Guide (described below) was, in part, motivated by as well as the creation of a *sustainable* system to disseminate a career intervention (OFG). Further, the GCA-ships were created to be mutually beneficial to the insitution (e.g., more career counselors, better integration of graduate students into the campus culture) and doctoral students (e.g., training, clinical experience, funding). <br>

The projects describe below highlight Dr. Bikos' love of vocational psychology (e.g., superivising the GCAs, teaching career development) and technology (e.g., creating the Canvas course). <br>

<br><br>

The Bikos RVT implements the campus-wide vocational intervention, **CALLED!  SPU’s Online Field Guide** (the OFG). The OFG was born out of a 3-year, campus-wide, task force that sought to meet the career development needs of the undergraduate students. The task force created a passport-sized, paper, [Field Guide](https://spu.edu/~/media/administration/center-career-calling/Vocation%20Field%20Guide/low%20res%20Vocation%20Field%20Guide.ashx); the BikosRVT translated it into Canvas. <br>

Each year, undergraduate students are presented with 6-10 activities (we avoid calling them "assignments") that assist them with adjusting to campus/college, self-exploration, exploring the world-of-work, job search skills, and discernment. The OFG remains available to the student after graduation.<br>

In support of the OFG, nearly every Bikos RVT member is an interventionist, analyst, or both.

*	Interventionists are assigned to a cohort of SPU students, providing feedback on OFG activities and responses to questions.
*	Analysts are crunching numbers from a random clinical trial that preceded the campus-wide implementation. 
*  *Quarterly checkpoints* are designed into the OFG and the suite of measures that follows a student (for up to five years) are selected for each incoming cohort of students. These provide an infinite well of longitudinal data around emerging adulthood for dissertations and MRPs.

# Graduate Career Advisors (GCAs)<br>
</div>
<div class = "row">
<br>
SPU’s [Center for Career and Calling](https://spu.edu/administration/center-career-calling) hire Graduate Career Advisors (usually working 6 to 16 hours per week) who provide career counseling and instruction (workshops, teaching career planning courses) to SPU students and alumni.  While these are competitive GAships, they often come from the Bikos RVT and Dr. Bikos provides clinical supervision and training in vocational psychology.

All RVT members benefit from the BikosRVT/Center or Career & Calling partnership. The two groups partner several times a year for training in the theory, research, and practice of career development/vocational psychology.
