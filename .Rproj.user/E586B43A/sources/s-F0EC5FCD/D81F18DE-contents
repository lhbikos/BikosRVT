We strive to create a culture of collaboration -- and fun.  In a typical year we:

* have a fall welcome party
* attend WPA together -- working hard, but also happy hours and tapas
* have a commencement BBQ
* when dissertation proposals and defenses are in person, RVT members bring treats a

Pictured below are snaps of some of the fun.

Clara (Thea) O’Brien (~ '26) is originally from Western Washington and moved to Seattle to pursue her doctoral degree in clinical psychology at SPU. She earned her BA in psychology from Pacific Lutheran University in 2015, where she conducted qualitative and quantitative research on children’s trust in adult testimony of healthfulness of foods. She has since spent time working in higher education as an academic coordinator at the University of Idaho before spending time in Europe travelling and volunteering in refugee aid. This is where she developed a passion for crisis care and acute interventions. She then went on to work in outpatient mental health serving adults suffering from SMI for three and a half years. This sparked her desire to pursue a higher degree in clinical psychology. She is interested in trauma work and acute care as it relates to underserved populations. For her Mentored Research Project she is studying the effects of affect and stigma on Mask-Wearing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are being examined in the context of COVID-19 infection rates as well as geopolitical context. She works as a Graduate Career Advisor in the Center for Career and Calling at SPU assisting undergraduate students in their career goals. In her free time, she enjoys drinking tea, listening to vinyl records, and backpacking. Pre-pandemic she is an avid concert and museum attender.

Beth Larson (she/her/hers; ~'22) was born and raised in Montana. She graduated with a BS from the University of Montana (2014), earning degrees in both Psychology and Communicative Sciences and Disorders, and graduated from Montana State University (2017) with an MS in Psychological Science (experimental psychology emphasis). She then moved to Seattle to pursue her doctoral degree at SPU (CPY) where she earned her MS in Psychological Science (2019). Beth ultimately chose SPU’s clinical psychology doctoral program because of its strong emphasis of both scientific research and clinical practice and because of its warm and supportive collegial environment. During her time at SPU, Beth has completed practicums at SPU’s Student Counseling Center (2018), Monroe Correctional Complex (2019), Tedd Judd’s Multicultural Practicum (2020), and UW Department of Neurology (2020). In the RVT, Beth has served as lead OFG analyst and as an OFG interventionist. Her dissertation explores the relationship between romantic attachment orientation, marital expectations, and trait mindfulness. In her free time, Beth enjoys hiking/urban walks, reading, and trying out new restaurants/coffee shops in the Seattle area.
